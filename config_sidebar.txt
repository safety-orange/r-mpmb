##[1.1 Download the PDF Sheet & Read the FAQ](https://redd.it/7gkjkw)
Get the sheets:

Note that the sheets only work with [Adobe Acrobat DC](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) on Windows or Mac OS!

&nbsp;

##[1.2 Download Content Scripts](https://redd.it/83m1gw)
The sheet only comes with SRD content. Visit [the sticky post](https://redd.it/83m1gw) to get additional scripts to import into the sheet.

&nbsp;

#2. Posting your creations

To share or get help with a script you made, please follow the [subreddit rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/mpmb/about/rules/) and post a **link to the script*** using a code sharing website:

* **[Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/)**;

* **[Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/)**;

* or another snippet sharing service that uses JavaScript syntax highlighting.

&nbsp;

Also take note of the following:

* Use **.js** as the file extension for formatting purposes;

* Include the URL in your post;

* Update the code when you make improvements (don't just take help, but share your creation).

&nbsp;

**Any sections of code less than five (5) lines may be included in a post. Anything longer must be posted using a third party snippet sharing service or will risk being removed.*

&nbsp;

#3. Creating new content for the sheet
Do the following if you want to add things to the sheet that aren't found in [the top post](https://redd.it/83m1gw):

1. Use the SEARCH function to make sure no one else has began work on what you're looking to do!
2. [Read the syntax](https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet/tree/master/additional%20content%20syntax) for what it is you're looking to create.
3. Make a post for your addition (with a link to the code, see above).
4. Check out the useful programs below.

&nbsp;

##3.1 Useful Programs & Documents

**Seriously... Do not use MS Word...**    
MS Word will use the wrong type of apostrophes and quotation marks for your JavaScript!

* **[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)** with [JSToolNpp](http://jsminnpp.sourceforge.net/)    
Notepad++ is the best lightweight tool to edit code. JSToolNpp is an add-on for Notepad++, to assist with JavaScript and JSON coding.

* **[Gisto](http://www.gistoapp.com/)**    
This is another lightweight tool, that is integrated with Github to allow you easily post Gists from within the app.

* **[Adobe Acrobat JavaScript API](https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/AcrobatDC_js_api_reference.pdf)**    
For learning to add functionality to the sheet, this is a must use reference guide!
